# Journal

Within this journal you will find articles and thoughts about the development and functionality of the **gobacktest** framework.

---

These journal entries are written as notes with a [slip-box][1] like [system][2], a.k.a [Zettelkasten][3].

Every entry file uses a naming scheme in the way of `YYMMDDhhmm_title-slug.md`. An example is `2006092041_some-title.md`.

`YYMMDDhhmm` translates to the date and time the file was created.

- `YY` the last two digits of the current year
- `MM` the current month written with two digits
- `DD` the current day written with two digits
- `hh` the current hour written with two digits in a 24 hour system
- `mm` the current minute

The title of the file is separated by an underscore `_` from the id. The title is written in lower case, each word separated by a hyphen `-` and should be as short and concise as possible.

Some articles specify the id in the form of `YYYYMMDDhhmm` which uses all four digits of the current year. As the first two digits with `20` will not change over the next 80 year, I just leave them out.
